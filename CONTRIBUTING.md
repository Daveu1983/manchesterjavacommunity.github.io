This repo is the code for the Manchester Java Community website. We're looking to build out this website as a place for 
people interested in Java and JVM can go to find out what is happening with the Manchester Java Community.

The list of issues we currently have open can be found at 
https://github.com/ManchesterJavaCommunity/manchesterjavacommunity.github.io/issues. Feel free to add any features/bugs 
here.

The website is built using https://jbake.org/, so have a read through of the docs to get familiar with the tech.
